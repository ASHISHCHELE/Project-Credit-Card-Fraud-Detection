# Project-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The goal of the project is to develop a predictive model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves analyzing historical transaction data to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.

Features Used : 
Data Patterns, Balancing , Imbalanced Data, Engineering Features, Selecting and Training Models Using Random Forest Classifier, and Deploying the best one for Real-Time Fraud Detection.

Tools Used : 
Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Imbalanced-learn,Joblib and AWS-Sagemaker are utilized.

Outcome :
The final model achieves high accuracy (>75%) on the test dataset,enhancing security and customer trust in credit card services.
Accuracy is 95% of the model.
